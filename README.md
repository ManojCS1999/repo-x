## E-Commerce Goods Shipment Duration prediction and Estimating Late Delivery Risk 
E-commerce goods Late delivery risk identification by predicting fastest and normal Shipping Durations. The Decision Tree model built my us, will enable E-commerce and Goods/products delivery industries to identify the 'risk of late delivery' and predict the fastest and normal duration of goods shipment for thier Inland and foreign clients/ customers/buyers.<br>
<br>
### GOAL <br>
i) Building a Multi-Output Decision Tree Regressor to Determine the maximum range of the shipping time, by predicting Fastest and Normal duration for shipping of goods for both Inland and International customers.<br>
ii) Building  a Binary Classifier to classify orders with high probabilty of late delivery (Late Delivery Risk analyser).
